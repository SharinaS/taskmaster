# Daily Change Log
### October 22: Day 1
Created a new directory and repo to hold the app, named taskmaster. Created three pages with very basic layout - homepage, add a task, all tasks. The homepage has two buttons, one which allows the user to go to the Add Task view, and the other that allows the user to go to the All Tasks view. Add a task page allows users to type in a title and a body for their task. Pressing the submit button shows a "Submitted!" label on the page. 

### October 23: Day 2
* Created a Task Detail Page with a title and Lorem Ipsum description
* Created Settings page that allows users to enter their username and hit save.
* The main page was modified to contain three different buttons with hardcoded task titles. When a user taps one of the titles, it goes to the Task Detail page, and the title at the top of the page matches the task title that was tapped on the previous page.
* The homepage contains a button to visit the Settings page, and once the user has entered their username, it should display “{username}’s tasks” above the three task buttons.
