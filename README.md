# Daily Change Log
### October 22: Day 1
Created a new directory and repo to hold the app, named taskmaster. Created three pages with very basic layout - homepage, add a task, all tasks. The homepage has two buttons, one which allows the user to go to the Add Task view, and the other that allows the user to go to the All Tasks view. Add a task page allows users to type in a title and a body for their task. Pressing the submit button shows a "Submitted!" label on the page.
